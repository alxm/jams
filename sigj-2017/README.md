## Instructions

### Controls

* Move with the arrow keys or controller dpad
* Press the Space bar or controller (A) to close the deal

### Goal

The goal is to pester people until they listen to your pitch. Keep getting in someone's face until their persuasion bar is full. When that happens, you have a chance to make your pitch and close the deal by pressing Space or (A) when "*Buy*" flashes on the screen.

The *Scam-o-meter* is set off when you pester someone, and the game is over when it's full. The *Scam-o-meter* freezes after a successful scam, and resumes when you get in someone's face again.
