**38th Century** is a simple world simulation game made from scratch in 72h for Ludum Dare 38.

When a century is up, use the clues you noticed every decade to make the best investment for the century ahead (in one of *defense, health care, industry, or science*). If your prediction was correct, your population will be sheltered from the inevitable disasters that strike every 100 years.
